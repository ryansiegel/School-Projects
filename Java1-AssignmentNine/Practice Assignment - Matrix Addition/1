A matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, arranged in rows and columns
For example, the dimension of the matrix below is 2 × 2 (read "two by two"), because there are two rows and two columns:
| 1 1 |
| 2 2 |
You are already provided the program “MatrixOperator” to “multiply” two matrices.
Your assignment is to code the “add” functionality to the existing program using loops and arrays.
Your first task is to learn briefly what a matrix is.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)
Just understand it briefly

    What it actually is.
    What is the structure of a 2x2 matrix

Then understand how matrix multiplication is done. Give the youtube links below a shot.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spr2F6jEuaw
Then analyze the “MatrixOperator” program given to you.
The two matrixes being multiplied in the program are already set.
       /*
         * assigning values for matrixone
         *    | 1 1 |
         *    | 2 2 |
         */
       
        /*
         * assigning values for matrixtwo
         *    | 4 4 |
         *    | 5 5 |
         */
Then understand what the “matrixoperator” program does.

    There are three class member two-dimensional array fields.
    matrixone – stores the first matrix data in the two-dimensional array.
    matrixtwo – stores the second matrix data in the two-dimensional array.
    matrixresult – stores the result of the matrix data for either the multiplication or addition operation the matrix data stored in matrixone and matrixtwo.
    There are four primary methods.
    initialize
    printAll
    multiply
    add
    main method

The initialize method initializes the matrixone and matrixtwo arrays with the matrix data.
The printAll method prints the matrix array data of matrixone, matrixtwo and matrixresult in a readable format into the console.
The multiply method multiplies the matrix data in matrixone and matrixtwo arrays and pushes them into matrixresult.
The add method is supposed to add the matrix data in matrixone and matrixtwo arrays into the matrixresult. This is the assignment part you need to complete and submit.
The main method creates the “MatrixOperator” instance and calls the multiply and add methods and prints the results using the printAll method.
To add the matrix data, the logic to do that can learned from

Please let your instructor know if you cannot understand and he will work with you.
The comments in the ‘add’ method already show the result expected.
/*    watch the below videos to understand the logic behind the matrix
         *    add logic
         *    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCmVpGv6_1g
         *    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_addition
         *    here is a website to validate your results.
         *    https://matrix.reshish.com/multiplication.php
         *    expected result for multiplying matrix 1 with matrix 2 would be
         *    | (1+4) (1+4) |
         *    | (2+5) (2+5) |
         *   
         *    so the result would look like
         *    |  5  5 |
         *    |  7  7 |
         */
       
So please make sure you verify your results before you submit your java file.
When you are ready to submit your assignment, Just submit the updated MatrixOperator.java file
